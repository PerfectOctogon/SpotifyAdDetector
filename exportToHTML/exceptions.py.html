    If you encounter this exception, you may want to check the following: 
        * Check your selector used in your find_by... 
        * Element may not yet be on the screen at the time of the find operation, 
          (webpage is still loading) see selenium.webdriver.support.wait.WebDriverWait()

    Stale means the element no longer appears on the DOM of the page. 
 
 
    Possible causes of StaleElementReferenceException include, but not limited to: 
        * You are no longer on the same page, or the page may have refreshed since the element 
          was located. 
        * The element may have been removed and re-added to the screen, since it was located. 
          Such as an element being relocated. 
          This can happen typically with a javascript framework when values are updated and the 
          node is rebuilt. 
        * Element may have been inside an iframe or another context which was refreshed.
